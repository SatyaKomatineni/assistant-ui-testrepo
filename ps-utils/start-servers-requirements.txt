Goal
**********************
1. write a  powershell script to start the servers
2. use a controlling shell to start the servers in parallel shells
3. list the servers that are started in the controlling shell and their process IDs
4. prompt the running servers to stop
5. wait for the servers to stop
6. confirm that the servers have stopped    

How to write the script
**********************
1. Encapsulate these steps in a function.
3. Make the functions globally available in the controlling shell.
4. Also remember the server names and their process IDs in a global variable.
5. The global functions are:
6. `Start-Servers` to start the servers.
7. `Stop-Servers` to stop the servers.
8. `List-Servers` to list the servers and their process IDs.
9. `stop-server-by-name` to stop a server by its name after prompting to select the server.
10. write a function start-process that takes a command and arguments, starts the process, and returns the process ID.
11. Fill the start-servers method with a sample start server command.
12. Also write a function that can prompt me the names of the global functions and their descriptions so that I can use them interactively.
13. Use comments to explain each step of the script.

Name of the script
**********************
The script should be named `start-servers.ps1`.
